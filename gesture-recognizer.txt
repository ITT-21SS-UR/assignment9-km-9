a) The $P Point-Cloud Recognizer is part of the $ Recognition family and recognizes gestures by decomposing them to a set of points. The point cloud discards the chronologically order of the points and just compares the distance between points. A recorded gesture is compared with a training set and then classified with the common Nearest-Neighbour-Approach.b)The $1 Recognizer only classifies unistrokes but the $P Recognizer can handle multistrokes as gesture input as well.c)The minimum matching distance compares all n! possible point positions of the candidate gesture C and template gesture T. This raises the question which point of C is assigned to which point of T. By converting the points to an undirected graph with the Euclidian distance as weights between each point. The graph with minimal costs is the minimum matching distance and therefore the classified gesture between C and T.
